            <p>Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have long held the promise of ultra-fast text generation through parallel decoding. Yet, this promise has remained unfulfilled—until now. In practice, open-source dLLMs have consistently lagged behind their autoregressive (AR) counterparts like LLaMA3 in inference speed, hindering their real-world adoption.</p>

            <p>Today, we are excited to introduce <strong>Discrete Diffusion Forcing (D2F)</strong>, a simple yet powerful strategy that shatters this speed limit. D2F creates a novel AR-diffusion hybrid model that achieves up to a <strong>2.5x speedup over leading AR models</strong> and a staggering <strong>50x acceleration over vanilla dLLMs</strong>, all while maintaining comparable output quality.</p>
            
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/img/d2f/fig1_main_result.png" alt="Bar chart comparing inference throughput of D2F with other DLLMs and AR models.">
                <figcaption>D2F is the first open-source dLLM to decisively surpass similarly-sized AR models like LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5 in inference throughput (Tokens/Second).</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>The Bottleneck: Why Were Diffusion LLMs Slow?</h3>
            <p>The potential of dLLMs lies in parallel decoding, but two fundamental issues have historically crippled their speed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>KV Cache Incompatibility:</strong> The problem starts with <strong>bidirectional attention</strong>, where every token can see every other token. This holistic view is powerful for quality but prevents the use of the Key-Value (KV) Cache—a critical optimization in AR models that saves massive amounts of redundant computation.</li>
                <li><strong>Strict Inter-Block Dependency:</strong> Previous attempts to enable caching by generating text in blocks were still stuck. They required each block to be fully denoised before starting the next, killing any hope of true parallel processing across blocks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The D2F Solution: A Hybrid of Speed and Power</h3>
            <p>D2F overcomes these bottlenecks by rethinking how dLLMs are trained and how they generate text. It's a two-part solution.</p>

            <h4>Architecture: Block-wise AR meets Parallel Diffusion</h4>
            <p>At its core, D2F reframes generation as a <strong>block-autoregressive</strong> process. Text is produced in sequential blocks, but with a crucial architectural twist in the attention mechanism:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attention <em>within</em> a block remains <strong>bidirectional</strong> to capture rich local context.</li>
                <li>Attention <em>between</em> blocks is made <strong>causal</strong>, meaning a block only attends to previously completed blocks.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This smart hybrid design makes D2F fully compatible with the standard KV cache, slashing a huge source of computational waste.</p>

            <h4>Method: Asymmetric Distillation and Pipelined Inference</h4>
            <p>With this new architecture, D2F uses an elegant strategy for training and inference:</p>
            <p><strong>Training with Asymmetric Distillation:</strong> Instead of costly training from scratch, we use an efficient distillation process. A powerful, pre-trained dLLM (the "teacher") distills its knowledge into our D2F model (the "student"). The teacher uses its full bidirectional view to make predictions, while the student learns to match them using only its limited, block-wise causal view. This process transfers the teacher's capabilities into our faster, cache-friendly architecture in just 12 hours on 8 A100 GPUs.</p>
            
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/img/d2f/fig3_overview.png" alt="Diagram showing the asymmetric distillation process for D2F.">
                <figcaption>Overview of D2F training: the student model (with block-wise causal attention) learns to mimic a pre-trained teacher model (with full bidirectional attention).</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p><strong>Inference with a Pipelined Parallel Decoder:</strong> This is where D2F’s speed truly shines. Because the model is trained to predict future blocks from <strong>partially incomplete</strong> ones, it doesn't need to wait. During inference, it runs a dynamic pipeline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A new block is added to the pipeline as soon as its predecessor is only partially complete.</li>
                <li>Blocks begin in a conservative "semi-activated" state and transition to an aggressive "fully-activated" state once they have enough context from the block before them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This creates a highly efficient, asynchronous workflow where multiple blocks are refined in parallel, maximizing GPU utilization and dramatically boosting throughput.</p>

            </figure>

            <h3>Putting D2F to the Test: Performance Highlights</h3>
            <p>D2F sets a new standard for dLLM efficiency across multiple benchmarks. We applied our D2F method to two popular open-source dLLMs, LLaDA and Dream, and the results speak for themselves.</p>

            <h4>Detailed Benchmark Results</h4>
            <p>The tables below show a direct comparison of our D2F-enhanced models against their original baselines and previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) acceleration methods.</p>
            
            <figure>
                <!-- Placeholder for Table 1: LLaDA Results -->

                <figcaption>
                    <b>D2F on LLaDA-Instruct-8B:</b> The results are transformative. D2F achieves up to a <strong>52.9x</strong> speedup on MBPP and <strong>29.1x</strong> on HumanEval over the baseline, while consistently outperforming previous SOTA acceleration methods.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <!-- Placeholder for Table 2: Dream Results -->
                <img src="assets/img/d2f/table2_dream_results.png" alt="Table comparing D2F-Dream with baseline Dream and other acceleration methods.">
                <figcaption>
                    <b>D2F on Dream-Base-7B:</b> The benefits extend across models. When applied to Dream-Base, D2F delivers a <strong>9.6x</strong> speedup on GSM8K-CoT with a <strong>higher accuracy score</strong>, demonstrating that speed doesn't come at the cost of quality.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>


            <h4>Superior Efficiency Frontier</h4>
            <p>Beyond raw numbers, D2F operates on a significantly better throughput-performance curve. The graph below shows that for any given performance level, D2F is drastically faster. For instance, on GSM8K, our model achieves <strong>3.1x higher throughput</strong> than LLaMA3 while also attaining a better score.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Discrete Diffusion Forcing (D2F) represents a fundamental leap forward for diffusion-based language models. By creating a smart hybrid of autoregressive and diffusion principles, it overcomes the critical inference bottlenecks that have long held dLLMs back. For the first time, an open-source dLLM can not only match but significantly <strong>exceed the speed of highly optimized autoregressive models</strong>.</p>
            <p>This breakthrough establishes dLLMs as a practical, high-performance alternative for a wide range of text generation tasks, paving the way for new applications and further research into efficient, parallel-first language modeling.</p>
